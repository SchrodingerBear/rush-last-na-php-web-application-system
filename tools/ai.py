Use Rhetorical Devices: Your essay would greatly benefit from including rhetorical strategies like emotional appeals (pathos) or logical reasoning (logos) to make your points more compelling. Try introducing analogies or vivid language to create a stronger emotional response in the reader.
2.	Transitions and Flow: Although the logical flow is generally present, transitions between ideas could be smoother. Use linking phrases to help guide the reader through your points. For example, after explaining the process of photosynthesis, a better transition could be, "As a result of this process, plants provide essential energy to herbivores, and the entire food web is supported."
3.	Persuasiveness: Consider strengthening your persuasive tone. Use more evocative language to convince the reader why photosynthesis is crucial. Instead of simply stating that ecosystems would collapse without it, explore the emotional consequences of such a collapse‚Äîhow it would affect all life forms in the ecosystem, adding urgency to the argument.

CRITERIA:
""" + rubrics_criteria + """

IMPORTANT: The score for each criterion must be a percentage (0-100) OF the criterion's weight. For example, if a criterion has a weight of 20% and performance is excellent, the score should be 20. If performance is average, the score might be 10 (50% of 20%).

The overall_weighted_score should be the sum of all criteria scores, with a maximum possible value of 100.

Also evaluate if the essay is AI-generated or human-written, and include plagiarism assessment based on patterns in the text.
