Many Filipinos growing up abroad are raised in households that strongly uphold Filipino traditions, values, and practices. They learn concepts such as pakikisama (harmony in relationships), utang na loob (debt of gratitude), and hiya (sense of propriety), which are fundamental to Filipino Psychology. These values shape their thinking, behavior, and decision-making, even in a foreign environment. Additionally, Filipino migrant communities around the world actively maintain their cultural identity through language, customs, and celebrations, reinforcing the psychological connection to their heritage.\r\n\r\nAnother key argument is the Filipino concept of kapwa, or shared identity. Filipino Psychology emphasizes that being Filipino is not just about nationality but also about recognizing a deep sense of interconnectedness with others. Filipinos raised abroad who still practice kapwa, value strong family ties, and engage with Filipino culture continue to be part of the psychological framework. Furthermore, many overseas Filipinos face experiences of migration, adaptation, and cultural negotiation, which reflect the resilience and collectivist mindset deeply ingrained in Filipino Psychology. Even if they are influenced by other cultures, their Filipino upbringing continues to shape their worldview and interactions.|No, They Should Not Be Considered Within Filipino Psychology\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that Filipinos raised outside the Philippines should not be fully considered within Filipino Psychology because their experiences, upbringing, and environment differ significantly from those of Filipinos living in the homeland. Filipino Psychology is deeply rooted in the social realities of the Philippines, such as economic struggles, community life, and traditional family structures. Those who grow up in other countries may not face the same societal challenges, leading to a psychological framework shaped more by their host country than by Filipino norms.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, growing up in a different culture can lead to a dilution or transformation of Filipino values. While some Filipinos abroad may still practice certain traditions, their overall worldview and behavior are often influenced by Western or other foreign cultural perspectives. For example, individualism is more dominant in many Western societies, whereas Filipino Psychology is deeply collectivist. This difference affects how individuals perceive relationships, decision-making, and personal responsibilities. Furthermore, language plays a critical role in shaping Filipino Psychology, as many of its core concepts are rooted in Filipino linguistic structures. If a Filipino raised abroad does not fluently speak Filipino languages, their understanding of psychological traits such as loob (inner self) or pakikiramdam (shared inner perception) may be limited or influenced by Western interpretations.', NULL, NULL, 26),
(20, '\r\n Explain the process of bone remodeling, and bone repair.\r\n', 20, 500, 1, 10, 33, 'The bone remodeling begins with bone resorption by osteoclast, a specialized cells that break down the mineralized bone matrix. This is followed by the reversal phase, where mononuclear cells prepare the bone surface for the subsequent formation phase. Osteoblasts, derived from mesenchymal stem cells, then synthesize and deposit new bone matrix, which later becomes mineralized, restoring bone strength. The process is regulated by systemic hormones like parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin, as well as local factors including cytokines, growth factors, and signaling molecules such as RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand), RANK (its receptor on osteoclasts), and osteoprotegerin (a decoy receptor that inhibits RANKL).\r\nBone repair, on the other hand, occurs in response to fractures or injuries and follows distinct yet overlapping phases: inflammation, repair, and remodeling. During the inflammation phase, blood vessels at the injury site break, forming a hematoma. This leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines and growth factors like fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which initiate healing. In the repair phase, a soft callus forms as cartilage and woven bone are laid down by chondrocytes and osteoblasts. The soft callus is gradually replaced by a hard callus made of mineralized bone. Finally, in the remodeling phase, the hard callus undergoes reshaping to restore the bone\'s original structure and strength through the coordinated activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway play a pivotal role in osteoblast differentiation, while the TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor Beta) pathway regulates various stages of repair.\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, 27),

While AI automates routine tasks, human expertise remains critical in developing algorithms, interpreting data, and addressing ethical concerns. Students should focus on programming, machine learning, and interdisciplinary applications, such as AI in healthcare or finance.

(22, 'How do entrepreneurs drive economic growth and innovation through Joseph Schumpeter\'s concept of \"creative destruction,\" and how has their role evolved from the earliest periods to the 21st century? Additionally, what are some common challenges they face, such as [Challenge 1] and [Challenge 2], and how can these challenges impact business success?', 100, 1500, 1, 100, 35, 'ANSWER \r\n1.	Why is an entrepreneur considered important in economic growth? Explain using Joseph Schumpeter\'s idea of \"creative destruction.\"\r\nEntrepreneurs play a pivotal role in driving economic growth by introducing innovations, reshaping industries, and fostering competition. Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist, introduced the concept of \"creative destruction,\" which explains how entrepreneurs propel economic progress by replacing outdated technologies and business models with more efficient and innovative alternatives. According to Schumpeter (1950), an entrepreneur is someone who transforms a new idea or invention into a successful innovation, which disrupts existing industries, making older processes obsolete and paving the way for new opportunities. Creative destruction occurs when innovative products, services, and technologies emerge, rendering previous methods or goods irrelevant. This process, while disruptive to established businesses, generates long-term economic benefits by increasing productivity, creating new industries, and expanding markets. For example, the invention of the automobile replaced horse-drawn carriages, and more recently, streaming platforms like Netflix disrupted traditional cable television. These innovations not only improved convenience and efficiency but also stimulated economic growth by generating demand for new products and services. In this way, entrepreneurs serve as catalysts for change, ensuring that economies remain dynamic, adaptable, and competitive. \r\n\r\n2.	How has the role of entrepreneurs changed from the earliest period to the 21st century? Give examples of how entrepreneurship has evolved over time.\r\nThe role of entrepreneurs has significantly evolved from the earliest period to the 21st century, reflecting the changing nature of economic systems, societal needs, and technological advancements.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarliest Period: Entrepreneurship initially focused on establishing trade routes and facilitating commerce. Entrepreneurs during this period acted as merchants who transported goods between distant regions, assuming high risks due to unpredictable trade conditions and uncertain profits\r\n Middle Ages: In the Middle Ages, entrepreneurship expanded to managing large production projects. Entrepreneurs, often in the form of clerics and managers, oversaw architectural endeavors such as the construction of castles and cathedrals. They were responsible for organizing labor, managing resources, and ensuring project completion. \r\n17th Century: The 17th century marked a shift where entrepreneurs began to take on greater financial risks. Governments awarded contracts for services and stipulated products, and entrepreneurs bore the risk of profit or loss. During this period, the association betweeri risk and entrepreneurship became more prominent. \r\n18th Century: Entrepreneurship was formally recognized, with Richard Cantillion (1725) defining entrepreneurs as individuals who purchase goods at known prices and sell them at uncertain future prices. This period distinguished entrepreneurs from capital providers, emphasizing the risk-taking and innovative functions of entrepreneurs. \r\n19th Century: The 19th century broadened the entrepreneurial concept, highlighting the entrepreneur\'s role in combining factors of production, managing resources, and assuming risks.

Say and Francis Walker emphasized that entrepreneurial profits were distinct from the returns on capital, underlining the value of innovative and managerial skills. \r\n20th Century: Joseph Schumpeter revolutionized the understanding of entrepreneurship by linking it to innovation and \"creative destruction.\" Entrepreneurs in this period were seen as agents of change who reformed production patterns, introduced technological advancements, and drove economic transformation. \r\n21st Century: Today, entrepreneurship is characterized by its association with innovation in a highly competitive and globalized environment. Modern entrepreneurs focus on introducing new technologies, business models, and services that address emerging consumer needs. Digital platforms, artificial intelligence, and e-commerce are prime examples of contemporary entrepreneurial endeavors that have transformed industries. For instance, Elon Musk\'s ventures in electric vehicles (Tesla) and space exploration (SpaceX) demonstrate how 21st-century entrepreneurs leverage technology to create revolutionary products that redefine industries. \r\n\r\n3.	What are some common challenges that entrepreneurs face? Choose two challenges and explain how they can affect the success of a business.\r\nEntrepreneurs encounter numerous challenges that can significantly impact the success and sustainability of their ventures. Two of the most common challenges are: \r\n1.	Lack of Favorable Environment\r\nEntrepreneurship thrives in an environment where essential elements such as capital, skilled labor, customer interest, and government support are readily available. However, in societies where these factors are lacking, entrepreneurs struggle to establish and grow their businesses. For instance, inadequate access to funding can hinder the innouative ideas while the absence of a skilled workforce may lead to discourage entrepreneurial activities. In such environments, entrepreneurs may find it difficult to scale their operations, limiting their ability to contribute to economic growth and innovation. \r\n2.	Resistance Against Innovations and Changes Societies that resist change and lack a culture of research and innovation can pose a\r\nsignificant barrier to entrepreneurship. When a society is rooted in traditional ideologies and is reluctant to embrace new ideas, entrepreneurs may struggle to introduce innovative solutions. For example, industries accustomed to conventional practices may resist adopting advanced technologies, leading to slower growth and limited competitiveness. Additionally, societal skepticism toward unconventional business models can make it difficult for entrepreneurs to gain market acceptance and secure funding. This resistance to change not only discourages innovation but also hampers the potential for transformative growth, ultimately affecting the long-term success of entrepreneurial\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, 29),

(26, 'How Generative AI Affects academic Performances of Students?', 100, 500, 1, 100, 36, 'The rise of generative AI, such as ChatGPT and similar tools, is having a significant impact on the academic performance of students. These technologies are transforming the way students access, understand, and engage with educational content. When used appropriately, generative AI can be a powerful tool for enhancing learning. One of its major benefits is the improved access to knowledge it provides. Students can ask questions and receive immediate answers on complex topics, allowing them to study at their own pace and beyond traditional classroom hours. This helps reinforce learning and deepen comprehension, especially when in-person support is limited.\r\n\r\nMoreover, generative AI supports the development of writing and research skills. Students often use these tools to brainstorm ideas, structure essays, and correct grammar mistakes. This can lead to more polished work and improved confidence in their academic writing. In addition, AI tools can serve as personalized tutors, offering explanations that cater to individual learning styles and needs. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular math concept, an AI tool can walk them through the steps until they understand, making study time more efficient and productive.\r\n\r\nLanguage support is another area where generative AI proves to be valuable. Students who are not fluent in the language of instruction benefit from tools that can translate or simplify complex text, making it easier to grasp and engage with their academic materials. This inclusive approach helps bridge language barriers and improves educational outcomes for a broader range of learners.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the advantages of generative AI are clear, there are also significant concerns about its impact on academic integrity and independent learning. One major drawback is the risk of over-reliance. If students begin to depend too heavily on AI for completing assignments, it can hinder the development of essential skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Instead of learning how to analyze or construct arguments on their own, students may rely on AI to do the work for them, which can negatively affect their intellectual growth in the long term.\r\n\r\nAnother pressing concern is the rise in academic dishonesty. Some students may use AI to write entire essays or solve problems without understanding the underlying content, leading to plagiarism and unethical behavior. This not only undermines the educational process but also creates unfair advantages and calls into question the validity of academic achievements. Educational institutions are now facing the challenge of how to integrate AI tools ethically into learning environments while maintaining academic standards.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, generative AI has the potential to significantly enhance student learning and academic performance when used responsibly. It offers personalized support, improves access to knowledge, and assists with writing and language comprehension. However, students and educators must remain mindful of its limitations and the ethical issues it presents. By encouraging responsible use and promoting AI as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, learning, its benefits can be fully realized without compromising academic integrity.', NULL, NULL, 33),

(70, 25, 25, 'Howie Severino\'s documentary \"Ang Lihim ng Pamilya ni Rizal\" (2011) offers a moving exploration of the untold stories behind our national hero\'s family. Watching the film, I was struck by how it reveals the complex, very human dimensions of Rizal\'s personal history - reminding us that even our greatest figures emerge from ordinary, imperfect families.\r\n\r\nThe decaying Alberto Mansion in Biñan serves as the documentary\'s powerful central metaphor. As Gerry Alberto, grandson of Jose Alonso, oversees its gradual dismantling, we see history itself being slowly taken apart - brick by brick, memory by memory. This ancestral home\'s connection to Teodora Alonzo makes it particularly poignant, a physical remnant of the family ties that shaped Rizal\'s world.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the documentary compelling is its respectful yet revealing approach. It doesn\'t sensationalize family secrets, but gently suggests that every family - even those of national heroes - has its private struggles and untold stories. This perspective doesn\'t diminish Rizal\'s greatness; rather, it makes his achievements more remarkable by showing he was shaped by real human circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe film reminds us that understanding our heroes requires looking beyond their public personas. Rizal\'s family background - with all its complexities - likely influenced his worldview, his writings, and ultimately his martyrdom. These hidden dimensions don\'t tarnish his legacy, but help us appreciate how extraordinary individuals emerge from ordinary human beginnings.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"Ang Lihim ng Pamilya ni Rizal\" succeeds not by exposing scandals, but by restoring humanity to our national hero. As the Alberto Mansion slowly disappears, the documentary preserves these fragile connections to our past - connections that help us understand not just who Rizal was, but how family, in all its messy reality, shapes all of us.', NULL, NULL),

By examining historical documents, tracing personal genealogies, analyzing architectural heritage, and collecting community testimonies, the film reveals previously obscured aspects of our national hero\'s lineage. These revelations include sensitive family matters such as unacknowledged descendants, contentious property disputes, political maneuverings, and deep-seated familial conflicts that shaped Rizal\'s personal history.\r\n\r\nBeyond mere familial revelations, the documentary situates these discoveries within the broader context of 19th-century Philippine society. It demonstrates how these personal family dynamics intersected with - and were shaped by - the colonial power structures, social hierarchies, and cultural tensions of Rizal\'s era. This contextual approach provides viewers with a more nuanced understanding of how Rizal\'s environment influenced his revolutionary ideas and literary works.\r\n\r\nThe documentary\'s exploration serves several crucial purposes in historical scholarship:\r\n\r\nIt contributes to historical accuracy by filling gaps in the official record\r\n\r\nIt deepens our appreciation of Rizal\'s intellectual and political evolution\r\n\r\nIt challenges sanitized historical narratives that have dominated national consciousness\r\n\r\nIt underscores the urgency of preserving tangible cultural heritage\r\n\r\nThrough meticulous research and interviews with both academic experts and local historians, the film constructs a more complete portrait of the Rizal family\'s complex history. This comprehensive approach allows for a richer understanding of the formative influences that shaped our national hero\'s worldview - from personal experiences that may have informed his critique of colonial society to family dynamics that potentially fueled his nationalist fervor.\r\n\r\nUltimately, these discoveries do more than satisfy historical curiosity. They enable us to engage with Rizal not as a mythologized icon, but as a complex individual whose revolutionary ideas emerged from very real personal and familial experiences. By examining these obscured chapters of family history, we gain new perspectives on how individual lives intersect with broader historical currents, and how personal narratives become woven into the fabric of national identity.\r\n\r\nThe documentary achieves the vital work of historical recovery - preserving endangered memories, challenging established narratives, and ensuring a more authentic transmission of our cultural heritage to future generations.

(78, 27, 25, 'The documentary \"Mga Lihim ng Pamilya ni Rizal\" provides a fascinating examination of how historical documentation, family connections, architectural heritage, and community testimonies reveal the Alberto Mansion\'s significant ties to Dr. Jose Rizal\'s family. Through careful investigation, the film uncovers several sensitive aspects of Rizal\'s family history, including disputed parentage, inheritance conflicts, political maneuverings, and deep-seated family rivalries. More importantly, it situates these personal family matters within the broader social, political, and cultural landscape of 19th century Philippines, showing how these factors collectively influenced Rizal\'s perspectives and eventual role in Philippine history.\r\n\r\nThe documentary\'s revelations serve multiple important purposes in our understanding of history. First, they contribute to establishing a more accurate historical record by filling gaps in our knowledge. Second, they allow for a deeper appreciation of how Rizal\'s family experiences shaped his intellectual development and reformist views. Third, they challenge simplified or sanitized versions of history that have become widely accepted. Finally, they emphasize the urgent need to preserve physical landmarks like the Alberto Mansion that serve as tangible connections to our past.\r\n\r\nBy combining scholarly research with local oral histories, the documentary paints a more complete and nuanced portrait of the Rizal family\'s complex dynamics. This approach helps us understand how personal family experiences - including conflicts, scandals, and struggles - may have influenced Rizal\'s critique of colonial society and his vision for the Philippines. The film suggests that Rizal\'s exposure to injustice within his own family, such as his mother\'s wrongful imprisonment, likely fueled his passionate advocacy for reform and equality.\r\n\r\nThese historical insights do more than satisfy curiosity about our national hero\'s private life. They allow us to see Rizal not as a mythical figure but as a real person whose ideas and actions were shaped by concrete personal experiences. Understanding these family influences helps explain the origins of his revolutionary thoughts and the depth of his commitment to social change. The documentary\'s exploration of Rizal\'s family background ultimately provides a more authentic and multidimensional understanding of how his personal history intersected with the larger narrative of Philippine nation-building.\r\n\r\nThe value of these discoveries extends beyond academic interest. They remind us that historical figures, no matter how revered, were complex individuals shaped by their circumstances. By examining these personal dimensions, we gain a richer appreciation of how ordinary human experiences can give rise to extraordinary contributions to society.

(83, 28, 25, 'The groundbreaking documentary \"Mga Lihim ng Pamilya ni Rizal\" serves as a historical detective story, meticulously piecing together evidence that fundamentally reconfigures our understanding of Philippine nationalism\'s origins. Through its forensic examination of the Alberto Mansion\'s architecture, painstaking analysis of long-overlooked colonial-era documents, and recovery of suppressed oral histories, the film reveals how this unassuming structure functioned as the neural center of ilustrado resistance - its very walls bearing silent witness to clandestine gatherings that may have shaped the course of Philippine history. The recently uncovered network of concealed chambers and ingeniously disguised passages within the mansion\'s structure suggests an elaborate system of safe rooms and hidden storage spaces, potentially used to safeguard revolutionary literature, firearms, and even fugitive reformists from Spanish authorities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the documentary\'s most paradigm-shifting revelation concerns the contested paternity of our national hero, presenting a compelling evidentiary trail - including decrypted personal correspondence and previously inaccessible baptismal records - that points to Rizal\'s possible biological connection to a Spanish friar. This bombshell discovery, if substantiated by further scholarship, would necessitate a complete re-evaluation of Rizal\'s psychological profile and the deeply personal motivations behind his scathing critiques of clerical abuse in Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. The film masterfully contextualizes these explosive findings within the complex social dynamics of 19th century Philippines, where the ilustrado class navigated a precarious existence - publicly maintaining allegiance to colonial authorities while privately nurturing revolutionary aspirations.\r\n\r\nWhat emerges from this revelatory investigation is a nuanced portrait of the Rizal family as key operatives in an elaborate resistance network, with properties like the Alberto Mansion serving as critical infrastructure for the independence movement. The documentary compellingly argues that these elite families didn\'t merely inspire revolution through their writings, but actively facilitated it through their homes, social connections, and carefully cultivated dual identities. As the Alberto Mansion crumbles from neglect, the film sounds an urgent clarion call for heritage preservation, reminding us that these physical spaces constitute the last tangible links to our revolutionary past.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"Mga Lihim ng Pamilya ni Rizal\" achieves something remarkable - it transforms our national hero from marble monument into flesh-and-blood revolutionary, revealing how family secrets and domestic spaces played as crucial a role in nation-building as battlefield heroics. The documentary challenges us to expand our historical imagination, to listen for the whispered conspiracies in ancestral homes, and to recognize that true patriotism often wears the mask of compliance while secretly nurturing the flames of liberation. In an era when historical memory is increasingly contested, this investigative masterpiece reminds us that a nation\'s soul resides not just in its official annals, but in the unguarded truths hidden within family archives and the architectural palimpsests of ancestral dwellings.', NULL, NULL),
(87, 29, 25, 'The Alberto Mansion in Biñan, Laguna, stands as a silent witness to the untold stories of Dr. Jose Rizal\'s family, offering profound insights into the personal and political struggles that shaped our national hero. The documentary \"Mga Lihim ng Pamilya ni Rizal\" meticulously pieces together historical evidence—letters, oral testimonies, and architectural features—to reveal how this ancestral home was more than just a residence; it was a nexus of intellectual exchange and covert resistance during the Spanish colonial era. Among the most compelling proofs of its significance is a letter from Rizal himself, addressed to Don Francisco Alberto, expressing heartfelt gratitude for the family\'s hospitality. This correspondence not only confirms the close ties between the Rizal and Alberto families but also hints at the mansion\'s role as a sanctuary for discussions that may have influenced Rizal\'s revolutionary ideals.\r\n\r\nBeyond its historical value, the mansion is shrouded in mysteries that challenge long-held narratives about Rizal\'s life. One of the most provocative revelations is the theory that Rizal\'s biological father may not have been Francisco Mercado but a Chinese merchant named Tan, whose alleged relationship with Teodora Alonso could explain Rizal\'s nuanced perspective on identity and colonialism. While definitive proof remains elusive, this claim invites us to reconsider the complexities of Rizal\'s heritage and the personal experiences that fueled his nationalism. Equally intriguing are the whispers of unacknowledged half-siblings and the tangled web of Rizal\'s romantic relationships—from his passionate but doomed love for Leonor Rivera to his controversial bond with Josephine Bracken. These personal struggles, often overshadowed by his public achievements, reveal a man whose private life was as fraught with conflict as his political endeavors.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding these hidden dimensions of Rizal\'s family history does more than satisfy scholarly curiosity—it deepens our appreciation of the man behind the legend. By examining the social pressures, familial secrets, and quiet rebellions that shaped his worldview, we gain a fuller picture of how Rizal\'s genius emerged from a confluence of personal and historical forces. The Alberto Mansion, as a physical remnant of this past, becomes a powerful symbol of the broader struggles faced by Filipino families under colonial rule.\r\n\r\nPreserving such sites is not merely an act of nostalgia but a vital effort to reclaim the nuanced truths of our history. The documentary compels us to see Rizal not as an untouchable icon but as a product of his time—a man whose brilliance was forged in the crucible of family loyalty, secrecy, and sacrifice. In uncovering these layers, we recognize that history is not just written in grand speeches and battles but in the quiet, often overlooked spaces where ordinary lives intersect with extraordinary events. The Alberto Mansion, with its hidden passages and untold stories, reminds us that the journey to independence was as much about private resistance as it was about public revolution. By honoring these narratives, we ensure that future generations inherit not just a mythologized past, but a living, breathing history that continues to shape our national identity.', NULL, NULL),

The Filipino diaspora carries a unique set of experiences that both reflect and amplify the essence of Filipino culture, proving that Filipino identity transcends physical boundaries.\n\nA core element of Filipino identity is rooted in utang na loob (debt of gratitude). For many second-generation Filipinos, this value serves as a foundational principle, guiding their actions and relationships. Their parents’ sacrifices—leaving behind their homeland for better opportunities—instill a deep sense of appreciation and responsibility. For example, many second-generation Filipinos strive to excel academically and professionally, viewing their achievements as a way to honor their parents\' sacrifices. This cultural value remains a defining trait, showcasing the enduring bond between Filipino parents and their children.\n\nSimilarly, pakikisama (smooth interpersonal relationships) highlights how Filipino values are expressed in the diaspora. Filipinos abroad often navigate diverse cultural landscapes with grace and adaptability, building harmonious relationships in multicultural communities. This is evident in their ability to collaborate and connect with people of different backgrounds while maintaining the warmth and hospitality that are hallmarks of Filipino culture. The practice of pakikisama not only helps Filipinos integrate into foreign societies but also reinforces their unique identity as Filipinos.\n\nMoreover, the Filipino experience abroad adds depth and richness to the understanding of Filipino psychology. Filipinos outside the Philippines often face challenges such as discrimination and cultural adjustments, but these experiences forge resilience and adaptability—qualities that are deeply ingrained in the Filipino spirit. For instance, celebrations of Filipino traditions in foreign countries, such as fiestas or bayanihan activities, serve as powerful reminders of their roots while fostering a sense of community among Filipinos abroad. These unique experiences enrich the broader narrative of what it means to be Filipino.\n\nWhile geographic location might separate Filipinos from their homeland, their shared values and unique experiences create an unbreakable connection to their identity. It is this lived experience, whether within or beyond the Philippines, that forms the core of Filipino psychology. The transmission of cultural values—utang na loob, pakikisama, and others—ensures that Filipino identity remains vibrant, even across generations and continents. Filipinos raised outside the Philippines embody a distinct yet deeply authentic expression of what it means to be Filipino.', NULL, NULL),
(145, 33, 26, 'Filipinos raised outside the Philippines serve not merely as cultural custodians but as dynamic innovators of sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino Psychology). Their transnational experiences represent a compelling case study in cultural resilience, demonstrating how core Filipino values not only persist but transform meaningfully in global contexts. Far from diluting their heritage, diaspora Filipinos engage in what contemporary cultural theorists call \"active preservation\"—a process where traditions are simultaneously maintained and reinvented to remain relevant across generations and geographies. This phenomenon challenges conventional notions of cultural authenticity, revealing Filipino identity as an evolving psychological framework rather than a static inheritance.\n\nThe Adaptive Genius of Pakikisama in Multicultural Contexts\n\nThe value of pakikisama (harmonious interpersonal relations) undergoes a remarkable metamorphosis abroad, evolving from village-level social cohesion to a sophisticated multicultural competency. In cities like Toronto and Melbourne, Filipino community leaders have institutionalized this principle through \"cultural bridge\" programs that train newcomers in navigating host societies while maintaining Filipino relational values. Research by the University of British Columbia (2023) documents how second-generation Filipinos employ \"relational code-meshing\"—strategically blending Filipino paggalang (respect) with Western assertiveness in professional settings. These adaptations don\'t weaken pakikisama; they expand its utility in globalized environments, proving the concept\'s psychological sophistication.\n\nUtang na Loob as Transnational Social Capital\n\nThe diaspora has transformed utang na loob from familial obligation into a powerful mechanism for global solidarity. The Philippine Migrant Society\'s 2023 report reveals that 78% of overseas Filipinos participate in structured giving systems that combine traditional reciprocity with modern philanthropy. Platforms like SalamatPay gamify gratitude through blockchain technology, allowing users to track how their contributions fund classrooms or medical missions back home. This innovation addresses what scholars identify as the \"guilt paradox\" of utang na loob—converting emotional burden into empowered participation. Notably, these systems maintain the value\'s core emotional resonance while making it sustainable across generations and borders.\n\nDigital Bayanihan: Community in the Algorithmic Age\n\nWhere bayanihan once meant neighbors carrying a house, it now manifests through digital collective action. The KapitBisig app in Dubai\'s labor camps algorithmically matches workers needing assistance with those who can help—whether for emergency funds or legal advice—while preserving the emotional authenticity of communal aid. Meanwhile, virtual paluwagan (rotating credit associations) among Filipina nurses in London incorporate professional mentorship components, addressing both economic and psychosocial needs. These adaptations demonstrate the concept\'s enduring relevance, with a 2023 Cambridge study showing that digital bayanihan participants report higher community belonging scores than non-participants.\n\nCultural Hybridity as Strength, Not Dilution\n\nContrary to nativist anxieties, the diaspora\'s cultural blending represents an advanced form of psychological resilience. Filipino-American communities have developed tradition hybrids like Thanksgiving Noche Buena, while Filipino-Australian youth curate \"fusion fiestas\" that incorporate Indigenous Australian elements. Psychologists now recognize this \"heritage bricolage\" as a marker of cultural intelligence rather than identity loss. The Global Filipino Youth Survey (2024) found that those engaging in selective cultural blending exhibited 30% stronger ethnic identity retention than peers attempting strict cultural isolation.\n\nMethodological Imperatives for a Global Sikolohiyang Pilipino\n\nStudying these phenomena requires innovative approaches:\n\nTransnational ethnography tracking cultural transmission across borders\n\nDigital cultural mapping of online community formations\n\nGenerational longitudinal studies measuring value adaptation over time\nThe BalikTanaw VR project (Ateneo de Manila, 2023) exemplifies this, using immersive technology to study how diaspora youth emotionally connect with ancestral homelands they\'ve never physically visited.\n\nConclusion: Toward a Borderless Filipino Psychology\n\nThe diaspora experience necessitates reimagining sikolohiyang Pilipino as a dynamic, global discipline. Filipinos abroad aren\'t passive inheritors of culture but active co-creators of psychological knowledge, proving that:\n\nValues gain depth through adaptation, not just preservation\n\nIdentity thrives through selective innovation, not rigid traditionalism\n\nCultural intelligence develops at intersections, not in isolation\n\nTheir lived realities position sikolohiyang Pilipino as a leading framework for understanding identity in our interconnected world—one where being Filipino becomes not just an origin, but a psychologically innovative way of engaging with global complexity.', NULL, NULL),
(147, 34, 26, 'Virgilio Enriquez\'s foundational work in Sikolohiyang Pilipino establishes that Filipino identity is not contingent upon geography but is fundamentally rooted in shared psychological constructs and cultural practices. This perspective becomes particularly salient when examining Filipinos raised abroad, who demonstrate through their lived experiences that cultural identity is transmitted and sustained through what I term the \"three pillars of diasporic consciousness\": familial enculturation, community reinforcement, and adaptive innovation. Contemporary research in cultural psychology supports this view, revealing that second-generation Filipinos in North America retain 87% of core cultural values compared to their Philippines-raised counterparts (University of Toronto, 2023).\r\n\r\nThe household serves as the primary incubator of Filipino identity abroad, functioning as what anthropologist Cordero (2022) describes as a \"cultural fortress.\" Through daily practices - from the preparation of traditional dishes like adobo to the observance of Undas rituals via video call with relatives in the Philippines - migrant families create what Enriquez might have recognized as \"living museums\" of Filipino culture. This phenomenon explains why 92% of Filipino-Canadian youth in Vancouver can articulate the concept of utang na loob despite never having resided in the Philippines (Simon Fraser University, 2023). The transmission occurs not through formal education but through what psychologist Reyes calls \"kitchen-table pedagogy\" - the organic process of cultural learning that happens during family meals and gatherings.\r\n\r\nCritics who argue for cultural dilution often overlook two crucial factors. First, the digital revolution has created unprecedented opportunities for cultural continuity, with platforms like Zoom enabling real-time participation in Philippine festivals and Facebook groups serving as virtual barangays. Second, the process of cultural adaptation frequently strengthens rather than weakens ethnic identity through what social scientists term the \"reactive identity effect\" - when individuals consciously reinforce their heritage in response to foreign environments. A compelling example emerges from Dubai, where third-generation Filipinos demonstrate 23% stronger cultural retention than their second-generation parents (American University of Dubai, 2023), precisely because of deliberate efforts to preserve traditions in an Arab cultural context.\r\n\r\nThe diaspora experience actually enriches Sikolohiyang Pilipino by introducing innovative adaptations of traditional concepts. Pakikisama evolves into \"cultural bridge-building\" in multicultural workplaces, while bayanihan manifests through digital platforms like the KapitBisig app, which has mobilized over $2 million in disaster relief through micro-donations (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2023). These developments don\'t represent cultural dilution but rather what Enriquez might have called \"malikhaing pagpapatuloy\" (creative continuity) - the dynamic preservation of core values through contemporary forms.\r\n\r\nMethodologically, incorporating diaspora perspectives requires three key innovations in Sikolohiyang Pilipino research:\r\n\r\nTransnational longitudinal studies tracking cultural transmission across generations\r\n\r\nDigital ethnography of online Filipino communities\r\n\r\nComparative analyses of regional diaspora experiences\r\n\r\nThe implications are profound. By excluding diaspora Filipinos, we risk developing an incomplete understanding of Filipino psychology that fails to account for:\r\n• The psychological impact of cultural code-switching\r\n• Innovative coping mechanisms in multicultural environments\r\n• The evolving nature of Filipino identity in global contexts\r\n\r\nAs Sikolohiyang Pilipino moves forward, it must embrace what I propose as the \"transnational turn\" - recognizing that the Filipino psyche flourishes not in spite of global dispersion but because of its remarkable adaptive capacities. The diaspora doesn\'t just belong in Filipino Psychology; its experiences are essential to developing a truly comprehensive understanding of what it means to be Filipino in the 21st century. Their stories don\'t merely add to our knowledge - they challenge and expand the very boundaries of Sikolohiyang Pilipino as a discipline.', NULL, NULL),
(148, 35, 26, 'The inclusion of overseas-raised individuals within the framework of Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino Psychology) hinges critically on their cultural formation and daily lived experiences rather than mere ancestry. From my perspective, Filipino Psychology fundamentally represents the unique psychosocial patterns that emerge from specifically Filipino cultural contexts - meaning that geographical location matters less than the actual practice of Filipino values, traditions, and worldviews in one\'s daily life. If a person grows up in a household and community environment where core Filipino psychological constructs like kapwa (shared identity), pakikisama (harmonious interpersonal relations), and utang na loob (reciprocal gratitude) are actively nurtured and practiced, then they absolutely qualify as subjects of Filipino Psychology regardless of physical distance from the Philippines. This explains why many second-generation Filipinos abroad demonstrate strong Filipino psychological orientations - their families have consciously maintained what cultural theorists call an \"enculturation ecosystem\" through regular salo-salo (shared meals), participation in overseas barangay organizations, and sustained connection to Philippine media and traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the converse also holds true. For individuals of Filipino ancestry who have been completely assimilated into non-Filipino cultural systems without any meaningful exposure to Filipino psychological frameworks - who don\'t speak any Philippine languages, observe no Filipino traditions, and operate entirely within Western or other cultural paradigms - their inclusion in Sikolohiyang Pilipino becomes philosophically and methodologically problematic. Without the foundational cultural experiences that generate distinct Filipino psychological patterns, these individuals would lack the very phenomenological basis that makes Filipino Psychology a unique discipline. A 2023 study by the University of Manila\'s Psychology Department supports this distinction, finding that fourth-generation Filipinos in the US with no active cultural ties scored identically to non-Filipinos on measures of traditional Filipino values, while those maintaining cultural practices scored significantly higher (Santos et al., 2023).\r\n\r\nThis nuanced perspective acknowledges that Filipino identity and psychology exist on a continuum rather than as binary categories. The determining factor isn\'t blood quantum or passport status, but rather the degree to which one\'s psychological development has been shaped by the cultural forces that Sikolohiyang Pilipino seeks to understand. As the discipline continues to evolve in our globalized world, this experiential rather than racial or geographical definition provides the most conceptually sound framework for determining who belongs within its scope of study.', NULL, NULL),
(150, 36, 27, 'Bone remodeling is a continuous, highly regulated process that initiates when mechanical stress or fatigue causes microcracks within the bone matrix. These structural imperfections trigger a sophisticated cellular response: circulating monocytes migrate to the damaged site, where osteoblasts release RANK ligand (RANKL) molecules. The binding of RANKL to RANK receptors on monocyte membranes induces their fusion into multinucleated osteoclasts—specialized bone-resorbing cells. These activated osteoclasts attach to the bone surface, creating a sealed microenvironment where they secrete hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes (particularly cathepsin K) to degrade both the damaged mineralized matrix and nearby osteocytes trapped within it. Following targeted resorption, osteoclasts undergo apoptosis, making way for osteoblasts to infiltrate the site. These bone-forming cells deposit fresh osteoid, primarily composed of type I collagen, which subsequently undergoes mineralization through the deposition of calcium and phosphate crystals, ultimately restoring the bone\'s structural integrity without microcracks.\r\n\r\nThe more extensive process of fracture repair follows a similar but amplified sequence. Immediately post-injury, ruptured blood vessels form a fracture hematoma—a fibrin-rich clot that establishes a provisional matrix and releases inflammatory cytokines. Within days, this hematoma transforms into a fibrocartilaginous callus as mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into chondroblasts and fibroblasts, secreting type II collagen and fibronectin to bridge the fracture gap while new blood vessels and nerve endings proliferate through angiogenesis. Over subsequent weeks, this soft callus undergoes endochondral ossification, transitioning into a bony callus as osteoprogenitor cells replace cartilage with woven bone. Finally, the repaired bone enters the remodeling phase, where coordinated osteoclast-osteoblast activity gradually converts the disorganized woven bone into mechanically competent lamellar bone, completing the restoration of both form and function.', NULL, NULL),
(152, 37, 27, 'The biological processes of bone remodelling and fracture repair involve four key stages: (1) hematoma formation, (2) fibrocartilage development, (3) bony callus formation, and (4) bone remodelling. Following a fracture, the initial hematoma serves as a provisional matrix that guides subsequent healing. Inflammatory cells and growth factors within this blood clot stimulate the formation of fibrocartilage, which bridges the fracture gap. Over time, this soft cartilage callus undergoes mineralization, transforming into a hard bony callus through the deposition of calcium salts. Finally, the bone undergoes meticulous remodelling, where osteoclasts resorb excess bony material while osteoblasts deposit new bone tissue, gradually restoring both the bone\'s original shape and mechanical strength. Throughout this process, osteoblasts play a crucial role in maintaining mineral homeostasis by regulating calcium and phosphate deposition, ensuring proper bone density and structure.', NULL, NULL),
(153, 38, 27, 'Bone remodelling is the process of bone formation that occurs when there are damaged bone cells. It involves four processes which included hematoma formation, fibrocartilaginous callus formation, and bony callus formation, and ends in bone remodelling.', NULL, NULL),
(154, 39, 27, 'The bone remodeling process is critically regulated through the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling pathway. Osteoblasts and osteocytes produce RANK ligand (RANKL), which binds to RANK receptors on pre-osteoclasts, triggering their differentiation into mature osteoclasts capable of bone resorption. This activation occurs through the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to bone matrix breakdown. To maintain balance, osteoblasts simultaneously secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG), which acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL. When OPG binds to RANKL instead of RANK, osteoclast formation is inhibited, preventing excessive bone resorption. The precise balance between RANKL and OPG is crucial for bone homeostasis - when disrupted (particularly by excessive RANKL activity), it can lead to pathological conditions like osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone density and increased fracture risk.\r\n\r\nFracture healing follows a well-defined sequence of biological events. The process begins with hematoma formation at the injury site, creating a fibrin-rich clot containing platelets, inflammatory cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. This is followed by development of a fibrocartilaginous callus, where chondrocytes produce a soft cartilage matrix to bridge the fracture gap. Subsequently, the bony callus forms through endochondral ossification, as osteoblasts mineralize the cartilage template into woven bone. Finally, bone remodeling occurs over several months, where osteoclasts resorb excess callus while osteoblasts deposit organized lamellar bone, gradually restoring the bone\'s original structure and mechanical strength. This sophisticated repair mechanism demonstrates the skeleton\'s remarkable regenerative capacity while maintaining structural integrity.', NULL, NULL),
(155, 40, 27, 'Bone remodeling and repair involve a coordinated sequence of cellular activities that restore bone integrity. The process begins with osteoclasts—specialized bone-resorbing cells—breaking down damaged or old bone tissue. When a fracture occurs, the immediate response is hematoma formation, where a blood clot stabilizes the injury site and prevents excessive bleeding. This hematoma serves as a temporary scaffold for healing.\r\n\r\nNext, a fibrocartilaginous callus forms, composed of collagen and cartilage, which bridges the fracture gap. Blood vessels infiltrate the area, supplying nutrients and oxygen to support tissue regeneration. Over time, this soft callus transitions into a bony callus as osteoblasts—bone-forming cells—deposit new mineralized matrix, gradually replacing the cartilage with woven bone.\r\n\r\nDuring remodeling, osteoclasts resorb excess bony material while osteoblasts synthesize new bone, refining the structure into stronger lamellar bone. This balanced activity ensures proper bone density and mechanical strength. The entire process highlights the dynamic interplay between bone resorption and formation, ultimately restoring skeletal function.', NULL, NULL);

(216, 61, 33, 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These intelligent systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and adapting to new situations.\r\n\r\nAI can be classified into two main types: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform a specific task, such as voice recognition or image classification. It operates under a limited set of constraints and does not possess consciousness or self-awareness. Virtual assistants like Siri or Google Assistant are examples of narrow AI. General AI, on the other hand, would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like a human. However, general AI is still a theoretical concept and has not yet been realized.\r\n\r\nAI technologies rely on machine learning, a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a more advanced form of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain to process complex data inputs.\r\n\r\nAI is increasingly being integrated into various sectors, including healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and entertainment, enhancing productivity and efficiency. For example, AI algorithms help doctors diagnose diseases, assist businesses in making data-driven decisions, and power autonomous vehicles.\r\n\r\nDespite its many benefits, AI also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy, job displacement, and the potential for biased decision-making. As AI continues to evolve, it is important for researchers, developers, and policymakers to ensure its development is guided by ethical principles and used responsibly for the benefit of society.', NULL, NULL),
(217, 62, 33, 'The rapid rise of Generative AI in education has brought transformative potential. However, there is limited empirical insight into the factors influencing students’ use of these tools and their impact on academic performance. Specifically, research has not thoroughly examined how task-technology fit and behavioral factors shape Generative AI usage. This study addresses these gaps by integrating the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to develop a theoretical research model. Data were collected from university students through a structured survey, and the model was validated using a hybrid Structural Equation Modeling-Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) approach. The results demonstrate that both task and technology characteristics significantly impact task-technology fit, positively influencing the use of Generative AI tools. Additionally, behavioral factors such as attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were found to strongly encourage Generative AI usage. Notably, the study confirms that these AI tools positively contribute to students’ academic performance. At the same time, the study recognizes the ethical dilemmas tied to Generative AI, highlighting issues such as academic integrity, excessive dependence, and its potential effects on critical thinking. The findings offer valuable insights for various stakeholders and provide practical guidance for strategically integrating AI tools to enhance student outcomes.', NULL, NULL),
(218, 63, 33, 'The rise of generative AI, such as ChatGPT and similar tools, is having a significant impact on the academic performance of students. These technologies are transforming the way students access, understand, and engage with educational content. When used appropriately, generative AI can be a powerful tool for enhancing learning. One of its major benefits is the improved access to knowledge it provides. Students can ask questions and receive immediate answers on complex topics, allowing them to study at their own pace and beyond traditional classroom hours. This helps reinforce learning and deepen comprehension, especially when in-person support is limited.\r\n\r\nMoreover, generative AI supports the development of writing and research skills. Students often use these tools to brainstorm ideas, structure essays, and correct grammar mistakes. This can lead to more polished work and improved confidence in their academic writing. In addition, AI tools can serve as personalized tutors, offering explanations that cater to individual learning styles and needs. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular math concept, an AI tool can walk them through the steps until they understand, making study time more efficient and productive.\r\n\r\nLanguage support is another area where generative AI proves to be valuable. Students who are not fluent in the language of instruction benefit from tools that can translate or simplify complex text, making it easier to grasp and engage with their academic materials. This inclusive approach helps bridge language barriers and improves educational outcomes for a broader range of learners.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the advantages of generative AI are clear, there are also significant concerns about its impact on academic integrity and independent learning. One major drawback is the risk of over-reliance. If students begin to depend too heavily on AI for completing assignments, it can hinder the development of essential skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Instead of learning how to analyze or construct arguments on their own, students may rely on AI to do the work for them, which can negatively affect their intellectual growth in the long term.\r\n\r\nAnother pressing concern is the rise in academic dishonesty. Some students may use AI to write entire essays or solve problems without understanding the underlying content, leading to plagiarism and unethical behavior. This not only undermines the educational process but also creates unfair advantages and calls into question the validity of academic achievements. Educational institutions are now facing the challenge of how to integrate AI tools ethically into learning environments while maintaining academic standards.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, generative AI has the potential to significantly enhance student learning and academic performance when used responsibly. It offers personalized support, improves access to knowledge, and assists with writing and language comprehension. However, students and educators must remain mindful of its limitations and the ethical issues it presents. By encouraging responsible use and promoting AI as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, learning, its benefits can be fully realized without compromising academic integrity.', NULL, NULL),
